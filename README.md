### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Bruno.

I'm currently a Master's student from UChicago focusing on data analytics. I love to use R, Python, SQL, and Tableau to extract data, clean data, and analyze data. I always want to find interesting patterns in the data that help generate useful insights! I am hoping to find a summer internship in data analytics.
