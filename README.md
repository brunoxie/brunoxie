### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Bruno.

I am currently interned as a data analyst intern at @hudl. I'm now a Master's student from UChicago focusing on data analytics. I love to use SQL, R, Python, and Tableau to analyze data. I am always interested in finding interesting patterns in the data that help generate useful insights! If you share the same interest with me, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
