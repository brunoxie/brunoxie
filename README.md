### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Bruno.

I have strong passion for leveraging data engineering and analytics to drive impactful business insights. Currently, I work as a Data Operations Analyst at Acumen, LLC, where I manage and optimize complex ETL pipelines, ensure data integrity, and support critical healthcare analytics projects.

With a strong background in building data infrastructures, I've integrated advanced data validation frameworks and automated workflows. My work spans multiple domains, from healthcare analytics to sports performance tracking.

I'm skilled in using tools like SQL, Python, dbt, Airflow, Snowflake, AWS, Tableau, and Looker to optimize data pipelines and deliver actionable insights.
