### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Bruno.

I'm currently a Master's student from UChicago focusing on data analytics. I love to use R, Python, SQL, Tableau to extract data, clean data, and anlyze data. Find interesting patterns in the data that help generate useful insights is something I always want to do! I am hoping to find a summer internship in data analytics.
