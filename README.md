### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Bruno.

I am currently looking for a summer internship in data analytics in the US. I'm now a Master's student from UChicago focusing on data analytics. I love to use R, Python, SQL, and Tableau to extract data, clean data, and analyze data. I am always interested in finding interesting patterns in the data that help generate useful insights! If you share the same interest with me, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
